# papers

A lot of the writing in these papers is outright sloppy and not well thought out. Some of it I dare say is plain embarrassing! Many of these words were written under the influence of numerous energy drinks, insufficient sleep, and acute naivety. A lot of my drive in my twenties was to prove to myself that I had what it took to make it in infosec, contribute to the community, and demonstrate that I, too, could be "leet". In hindsight, I was very inexperienced back then (although probably more creative than now), and my perception of security risk was perhaps all too granular and laser-focused. However, I do find value in archiving these papers online. Every once in a while, I come across academic papers and the like describing "novel" offensive security techniques, only to realize that my peers and I had discussed those very attacks years prior.

No one can make it alone. I'd like to thank my personal sec heroes from whom I've learned so much. In no order of preference they are:
- Petko Petkov
- David Kierznowski
- Tomas Doran
- Jan Fry
- Adam Bolton
